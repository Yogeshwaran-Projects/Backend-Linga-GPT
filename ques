Astro is a modern front-end framework designed to build fast, optimized websites by focusing on speed and performance.

Unlike traditional frameworks, Astro generates static HTML at build time, allowing for minimal client-side JavaScript and improved load times.


It supports a wide range of front-end technologies, including React, Vue, and Svelte, making it flexible and adaptable for various development needs

Astro's approach to partial hydration means that only the interactive parts of the page are hydrated with JavaScript, which helps reduce the overall JavaScript footprint and enhances performance.
With its built-in support for Markdown and other content formats, Astro is ideal for building content-heavy sites like blogs, documentation, and portfolios.
